# Teebot
WORK IN PROGRESS 

Teebot is a tshirt folding robot that uses servos and a 5-panel system to fold tshirts. This robot was inspired by Sheldon from TBBT who used a platic contraption to fold his TShirts. Configuring the Oled+keypad system and rigging up the laying out mechanism and app-control posed some difficulty. Here are the materials I used:
1. SG90 Servo x 10
2. Arduino Uno R3/ NodeMCU ESP32 x 1
3. 5V phone charger x 1
4. 9V batteries x inf
5. Breadboard
6. Jumper wires
7. Push Button
8. Cardboard
9. Tape
10. Tools: Soldering Iron, X-acto knife, Wire stripper etc.
11. 128x64 i2c Oled
12. Keypad 4x4

Creating the hardware without access to any 3d modelling tools and printer was a challenge. The hardware is composed entirely of cardboard and tape, so not the most sturdy.
