# Teebot
WORK IN PROGRESS 

Teebot is a tshirt folding robot that uses servos and a 5-panel system to fold tshirts. This robot was inspired by Sheldon from TBBT who used a platic contraption to fold his TShirts. In. few monhs I will be responsible for my own laundry, so I decided to do take this up as a fun project to unwind. Just the folding part is a pretty beginner-level project, but rigging up the laying out mechanism and app-control posed some difficulty. Here are the materials I used:
1. SG90 Servo x 10
2. Arduino Uno R3/ NodeMCU ESP32 x 1
3. 5V phone charger x 1
4. 9V batteries x inf
5. Breadboard
6. Jumper wires
7. Push Button
8. Cardboard
9. Tape
10. Tools: Soldering Iron, X-acto knife, Wire stripper etc.

This project isn't very coding-heavy, but the creating the hardware without access to any 3d modelling tools and printer was a challenge. The hardware is composed entirely of cardboard and tape, so not the most sturdy. The coding part was pretty simple- a standard servo library for the servos. I do plan on making it IoT enabled that allows the user to enter the amount of tshirts via an app as well as a counting mehcanism (button+7 segment display). 

I also want to create a mechanism for laying out the tshirts, but no ideas as yet.
